In this exercise, we want to take a string of letters as input. If, after removing extra letters from the string, 
at the end, if remains word 'hello', print 'YES'. else print 'NO'
notice that typically we want to say hello correctly in another way.

for example:

input:

ahhellllloou

output:

YES

input:

hlelo

output:

NO
