The country's Kabaddi Federation officials are preparing teams to participate in the Kabaddi World Championships. 
According to the rules of the Kabaddi World Championships, each person can only participate in 5 Kabaddi World Championships. 
The president of the federation has gathered all the athletes in this discipline, each player has participated in the world 
championships a number of times to date. Kabaddi teams consist of exactly 3 people. The president of the federation wants 
to form teams that, if each of those teams is selected, can participate in the world championships together for at least 
3 years (i.e. each member of a team has participated in the world championships a maximum of 2 times)

The first line of input contains the number n, which is the number of kabaddi players in question. The next line of input 
contains n numbers separated by spaces, which indicate how many times each player has participated in the world championships. 
Print a number in the output that represents the maximum number of teams formed under the stated conditions.

5 0 4 2 1 0

output:

In the given sample input, players who have played 5 and 4 games cannot be in a group according to the question; therefore, 
only 4 players who have played 0, 2, 1, and 0 games can be in the groups. With 4 players, only 1 group of 3 can be formed. 
Note that you do not need to count the number of states (permutations).
