Lewis is preparing an online translator for his university thesis. The online translator that Lewis is 
preparing has a dictionary and at the end the translator has to translate a sentence.

The first line of input contains a number n, which represents the number of words in the dictionary. 
Each of the next n lines contains two words, indicating that the second word is the meaning of the first 
word. The next line contains a sentence. A sentence contains several words separated by spaces. Now you 
need to help Lewis and write a translator that reads the dictionary and the corresponding sentence from the 
input and translates the sentence. During the translation process, if a word is not in the dictionary, print 
the word itself in the output. For more information, see the sample input and sample output.

for example:

input:

hello salam
goodbye khodafez
say goftan
we ma
you shoma
we say goodbye to you tonight

output:

ma goftan khodafez to shoma tonight
