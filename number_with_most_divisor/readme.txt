In this exercise, we want to write a program that reads 20 numbers from the input and at the end prints the number with the highest
number of divisors along with the number of divisors in the output. If there are several numbers in this
state, print the largest one.

for example:

input:

767
665
999
895
907
796
561
914
719
819
555
529
672
933
882
869
801
660
879
985

output:

672 24
