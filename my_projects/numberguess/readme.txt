The steps of the game are as follows:

First, the user determines a number in his mind and does not tell the computer this number 
(does not give the number as input to the computer) (a number between 1 and 99)

We run the program

The program guesses and prints a number

The printed number creates three states

1- Either it is greater than the number you have in your mind, which you tell the program by 
typing the letter 's' that the number in your mind is smaller than the number printed by the 
program and the program must guess and display another number and ... (It is worth mentioning 
that in this case, by typing k, the program must guess a smaller number than its previous guess 
so that the game ends sooner)

2- Or the printed number is smaller than the number you have in your mind, which you tell the 
program by typing the letter 'b' that the number in your mind is larger than the number printed by 
the program and the program must guess and display another number and ... (It is worth mentioning 
that in this case, by typing b, the program must guess a number larger than your previous guess 
so that the game ends sooner)

3- Or the printed number is the same number that was in your mind and by typing the letter 'c' you 
tell the program that it guessed correctly and the program ends
