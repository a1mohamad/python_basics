We wants to write a program that determines whether a word is a palindrome or not. 
A palindrome is a word that is the same whether read from left or right. For example, 
Madam is a palindrome, but Tehran is not.
Please note that it does not matter whether the letters are lowercase or uppercase, as 
we said Madam is a palindrome, just as maDAM is a palindrome.

for example:

input:

madam

output:

palindrome

input:

Tehran

output:

not palindrome
