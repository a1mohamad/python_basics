In this program, read a positive number from the input and determine whether it is prime or not.
Definition of a prime number: A number that is not divisible by any other number except one and 
itself. For example, 7 is prime because it is divisible by only one and 7. The number 6 is not 
prime because it is divisible by 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6.

If the number is prime, print the statement prime in the output, and if it is not prime, print 
the statement not prime in the output. Please make sure that the output is exactly as stated. 
Lowercase letters are important.

for example:

input:
