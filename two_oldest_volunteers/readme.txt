In this exercise we get volunteers age and give two oldest ones.
Write a program that reads the ages from input and prints the ages 
of the oldest and the second oldest in the output. Your program 
will continue reading from input until a negative number of one 
is entered. As soon as this number appears in the input, the 
program should stop reading the input and print the oldest age. 
The ages of the individuals are in the range of 10 to 90 years. 
It is guaranteed that the ages of the candidates in the input 
are unique (i.e. no two individuals in the input will have the same age).

for example:

input:

17
15
39
51
14
32
28
-1

output:

51 39
