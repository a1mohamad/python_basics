Write a program that reads a number of positive numbers from the input and prints their square roots
to 4 decimal places.

The first line of input shows the number n, which is the number of numbers whose square roots you need 
to calculate. Each of the next n lines contains a positive number. For more information, see the input 
and output examples. Hint: In this exercise, you should use the math library and the sqrt function from 
that library.

Please note that the output should not be rounded in any way. Print exactly 4 decimal places.

for example:

input:

4
1
2
19
100

output:

1.0000
1.4142
4.3588
10.0000
