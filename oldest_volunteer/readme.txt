In this exercise, we receive all volunteers ages and then give oldest one.
Write a program that reads the ages of from input and prints the age of 
the oldest one in the output. Your program will continue reading from input 
until a negative number of one is entered. As soon as this number appears 
in the input, the program should stop reading the input and print the oldest 
age. The ages of the individuals are in the range of 10 to 90 years.

for example:

input:

17
15
39
51
14
32
28

output:

51
