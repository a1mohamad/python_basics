We want to write a program that determines whether AB and BA can be found in another string, 
knowing whether they overlap. The order of AB and BA is not important. For example, if the 
input is ABBA, the answer is YES. If the input is BAAB, the answer is YES. But if the input 
is ABA, the answer is NO, or if the input is ABHA, the answer is NO.

Please print YES and NO in capital letters exactly as they appear in the output.

for example:

input:

BAAB

output:

YES

input:

ABBH

output:

NO
