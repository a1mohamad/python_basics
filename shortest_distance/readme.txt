three old friends want to meet each other. Eve, John and Mary plan to meet each other
 at a point. The houses of these three people are located on a straight line (x-axis). 
Eve's house is located at point x1, John's house is located at point x2 and Mary's house 
is located at point x3. They want to travel the shortest distance in total. Given 
x1, x2, x3, calculate the shortest distance that these three need to travel in total to 
meet each other at a point. Please print the correct answer without a decimal point if 
it is correct. For example, in the example below, if you print 6.0, it is incorrect.

Note that the distance is the desired distance, not the place where they are supposed to meet.
